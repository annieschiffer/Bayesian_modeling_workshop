## Bayesian modeling with *rstan* and *brms* Workshop

This workshop is part of the USU Ecology Center Data Science workshop series. The materials are typically emailed to workshop participants before the workshop. Participants follow along in the RMarkdown file and complete the exercises to practice using *rstan* and *brms* to fit a Bayesian model.

The repository includes the RMarkdown file and the HTML output file. This workshop is intended for folks who have fit a frequentist model before but are curious about Bayesian modeling, or who want to learn how to fit a model with *rstan* or *brms* specifically.

## Topics

* Why use Bayesian models for inference?
* New terms: priors and posterior
* How to build a Bayesian model in rstan
* A shortcut: brms
